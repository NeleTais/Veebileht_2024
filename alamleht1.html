            <h2>Getting things done</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Getting Things Done method is a system developed by productivity consultant David Allen in which you capture tasks and ideas in an external system to declutter your brain, allowing you to concentrate on the execution rather than remembering everything.It works by simply maintaining lists. You will have to make the following lists:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In</li>
                <li>Next actions</li>
                <li>Waiting for</li>
                <li>Projects</li>
                <li>Someday/Maybe</li>
            </ol>
            <!--need imelikud sinised asjad teevad "" sõnade ümber-->
            <h3>The &ldquo;in&rdquo; list</h3>
            <p>The &ldquo;in&rdquo; list is where you capture ideas and tasks as they occur to you. Capture anything that crosses your mind &mdash; tasks, events, ideas, book recommendations, etc. &mdash; and store it outside your brain in an inbox. </p>

            <p>Clarify everything you captured into concrete actionable steps. Now that your inbox is full of tasks, ideas, notes, commitments, etc., it&rsquo;s time to go through each item, refine it, and add as much information as you need to prevent having to puzzle over it later. Then sort all of them into other lists.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The &ldquo;next actions&rdquo; list </h3>
            <p>The &ldquo;next actions&rdquo; list is a list of your next actions, obviously. Another name for these actions is &ldquo;as-soon-as-possible actions&rdquo;&mdash;it is simply those things from which you will pick what to work on when you have time.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The &ldquo;waiting for&rdquo; list </h3>

            <p>When you delegate work to others, send an email you expect a reply to, order something, or have a task that is &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; because you are waiting for someone else to do something, it should be written down on your &ldquo;waiting for&rdquo; list.</p>
            <br>
            <h3> The &ldquo;projects&rdquo; list </h3>

            <p>GTD&rsquo;s definition of a project is very broad. It defines any objective that requires more than one action to complete as a project. These projects should go on your &ldquo;projects&rdquo; list. </p>
            <p>This list is simply a list of project titles and&mdash;if you like&mdash;descriptions and intended outcomes of the projects. When reviewing the &ldquo;projects&rdquo; list, you will make sure that there is always at least one action on your next actions list for each project, thus making sure that your projects make progress and aren&rsquo;t forgotten.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The &ldquo;someday/maybe&rdquo; list</h3>
            <p>When you have a project you want to realize when you have more time, but you don&rsquo;t want to have it &ldquo;pollute&rdquo; your &quot;next actions&rdquo; lists or your list of &ldquo;projects&rdquo; either put it to your &ldquo;someday/maybe&rdquo; list. </p>
            <p>This list simply contains ideas and projects you might want to realize at some time in the future.</p>
