            <p>Leitners system is a flashcard study method. It employs the concept of spaced repetition, which is an approach to memorization that uses time intervals. To get started with the Leitner System, you need two things: Flashcards (that feature the topics and material you are studying) Boxes Label each box with a designated study time period. For example: Box 1: Every day Box 2: Every other day Box 3: Every week</p>

            <h3>How to Start Studying with the Leitner System</h3>

            <p>All your flashcards should begin in Box 1. Begin reviewing each flashcard, quizzing yourself on if you can recall or explain the information on each side. If you answer a flashcard correctly, move the card into Box 2. If you miss it, place the card back into Box 1. Once you&rsquo;ve gone through all your flashcards, you&rsquo;ll see a distinction between the cards you are more familiar with are sitting in Box 2, while concepts you still need to work on remain in Box 1. Continue this method each time you review your flashcards. If you get a card correct, move it to the next box. If you get the card wrong, move it back to the previous box. Once all your cards are in Box 3, you&rsquo;ve successfully studied all your material.</p>
