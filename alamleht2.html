            <p>Information is learned when you can explain it and use it in a wide variety of situations. </p>
            <p>The Feynman Technique is the best way to supercharge your learning. Devised by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, it leverages the power of teaching for better learning. There are four steps to the Feynman Learning Technique.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Study</h3>

            <p>All you have to do is choose a topic and start studying. Simply write down all of the things you know on a piece of paper. Try and break it down into its core components and seek to understand it as a whole.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Teach</h3>

            <p>Once you&rsquo;ve completely covered the topic, you&rsquo;re going to teach it to someone else. If you&rsquo;d rather avoid actually teaching someone, you can just teach it to an imaginary audience. But the Feynman technique works much better if you use a real person. </p>
            <p>They&rsquo;ll be able to give feedback and let you know when something isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Fill the gaps</h3>

            <p>Areas, where you struggle in teaching, are the points where you have some gaps in your understanding. Now that you know where you have gaps go back to the source material. Augment it with other sources. Look up definitions. Keep going until you can explain everything you need to in basic terms.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Simplify</h3>

            <p>Ideally, you&rsquo;ve already greatly improved your understanding of the target skill. Now you need to simplify the content. This step is extremely effective at building your cohesive understanding of a subject. To be able to cut away clutter and explain something so clearly that even young children with limited vocabulary can understand, is extremely difficult.</p>
            <p>Attempting to do this, forces you to not only deeply master the information/skill but to also grasp how all of the different elements join together.</p>
